                                <h1>Welcome!</h1> I am Newt, a strange creature searching for meaning in a life defined by meaninglessness.
                                I've been fascinated by stories of all kinds, and use them as a way to derive meaning. I started life
                                as a programmer, but have since turned into more of a researcher and writer. While I'm fascinated
                                by stories of all kinds and mediums, I am trying to teach myself the art of adaptation rather than
                                creation. My interest in how these tales mutate with each retelling, and as such I do a lot of writing
                                on established works.

                                I went to college for programming, but have always had a love of art. I've spent some time doing 3D modeling,
                                drawing and even some real life sculpting. During my time as a Twitch streamer I put my abilities as a
                                writer to use, allowing me to craft a world that my stream's events took place in. As a YouTube creator I started
                                to use Gimp more often, and now have a decent understanding of how to make professional looking thumbnails for
                                the purposes of attracting attention. On top of all of this, I spend plenty of time writing and reviewing scripts
                                and working with others on videos. None of my projects are solo, though I arguably have the largest part in each one.

                                Due to my large number of interests, I'm always driven to learn new skills. This means I'm constantly
                                facing situations or problems I've never seen before, or looking back at issues I once thought impossible
                                with my current skill set. I despise working on the same rote issues day after day, which has led me
                                to quit a few jobs once I felt I wasn't learning anything new from them.

                                Regardless of what I do, I do not do so half-heartedly. I have been known to spend years on my passion projects.
                                I don't expect that to change anytime soon. Works on projects like my Lobotomy Corporation story retrospective
                                took over a year, and if I'm capable to doing projects like this while still feeding myself, I absolutely will.

                            <p>
                                The Dark Forest is a world created alongside my Twitch streams. While it initially
                                began as a goofy little side project, it grew into a pretty large idea. It was my first world
                                to be created in WorldAnvil, and it's still occasionally being added to today. It helped me
                                theme many of the events I used for my stream, and it's where the Campgrounds dwell.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Its main storyline chronicles the life of Zephnos, a not-so-happy forest creature tasked with keeping
                                humans away from the Campgrounds. Created to be a captive audience, he's nonetheless conscripted
                                by the Dark Forest itself to act as a guardian for the Campgrounds -- but he's never able to
                                come into the light himself. Over time, it's revealed that much of Zephnos' history is repeating,
                                and it's this repetition that began my interest in story mutation. Zephnos and the forest he
                                dwells in are both very personal to me, even if I don't think they're exactly unique. Indeed,
                                that lack of uniqueness is somewhat the point, as the Dark Forest is known for its tendency
                                to harvest stories and characters.

                                Moonsreach is my second WorldAnvil world. Connected to the Dark Forest
                                through a single character, it's easily the most alien story idea I've ever had... in that all
                                of its characters are literally aliens.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Developed over the course of a single weekend, Moonsreach actually has a complete history
                                from start to finish. This was made much easier through collaboration with my close friend iZ,
                                who helped me hammer out many ideas incredibly fast. While Moonsreach could absolutely be fleshed
                                out more, it was an important step towards understanding the Dark Forest multiverse.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Moonsreach established that the gods in this setting are predatory, and see most sentient life
                                as nothing more a way to accumulate more and more power as they exist. They continue to raise
                                civilizations not out of pride or benevolence, but because it benefits them in the long run.
                                It's this fact that sets the tone for the Dark Forest's gods.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                This is by far my most interesting idea, and one I'd love to flesh out more if I ever found
                                the time. As a world with three completely different alien races who depend on each other to
                                survive, something about it just feels... compelling. Add into this that the planet has no sun
                                and is completely tied to its orbiting lunar goddesses for survival, and there's a ton to play with.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                And then of course there's the extra idea that Moonsreach is a massive water world. Completely
                                sheathed in ice all the way up to the barely-present atmosphere, it's a world of ridiculous
                                extremes. Without divine intervention, life would struggle to exist here at all.
                            </p>

                                Rules of the Dark Forest prevent the monsters that stalk it from entering the light, meaning
                                it's the only place people who fall into it can spend the night without fear. That's changed
                                over time, but this is a story that never fully met its end... fittingly, given that its
                                themes lie in stagnation, corruption of purpose, and an acceptance of the status quo. Thanks
                                to the events of the Dark Forest, nothing ever truly dies.

                                This was initially concieved as a way to explain the story events within my Twitch streams,
                                but grew into far more than that. I've tried to tell the Salamanders' (and Zephnos') story
                                three separate times, but something always stops it. Maybe I'll resume it again sometime
                                in the future.
