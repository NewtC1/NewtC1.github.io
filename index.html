                                I am Newt, a strange creature searching for meaning in a life defined by meaninglessness.
                                I've been fascinated by stories of all kinds, and use them as a way to derive meaning. I started life
                                as a programmer, but have since turned into more of a researcher and writer. While I'm fascinated
                                by stories of all kinds and mediums, I am trying to teach myself the art of adaptation rather than
                                creation. My interest in how these tales mutate with each retelling, and as such I do a lot of writing
                                on established works.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Even I don't fully understand where my interest in stories comes from. I love all of them --
                                even the bad ones. I'm not looking for quality of stories, but and understanding of why we
                                write them and how we tell them. For me, stories and memories are a large part of the human
                                identity. Without the tales we tell around the fire we cannot communicate who we are. It's by
                                understanding another person's history that we can bridge the gap in human experience, and
                                I think this is a large part of why we feel obliged to tell them.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Ultimately, these differences in perspective and the mutations they create in retelling the
                                same story are where my interest lies. If I can understand that and find a way to quantify
                                it, I can understand others -- and myself -- better.

                                I went to college for programming, but have always had a love of art. I've spent some time doing 3D modeling,
                                drawing and even some real life sculpting. During my time as a Twitch streamer I put my abilities as a
                                writer to use, allowing me to craft a world that my stream's events took place in. As a YouTube creator I started
                                to use Gimp more often, and now have a decent understanding of how to make professional looking thumbnails for
                                the purposes of attracting attention. On top of all of this, I spend plenty of time writing and reviewing scripts
                                and working with others on videos. None of my projects are solo, though I arguably have the largest part in each one.

                                Due to my large number of interests, I'm always driven to learn new skills. This means I'm constantly
                                facing situations or problems I've never seen before, or looking back at issues I once thought impossible
                                with my current skill set. I despise working on the same rote issues day after day, which has led me
                                to quit a few jobs once I felt I wasn't learning anything new from them.

                                Regardless of what I do, I do not do so half-heartedly. I have been known to spend years on my passion projects.
                                I don't expect that to change anytime soon. Works on projects like my Lobotomy Corporation story retrospective
                                took over a year, and if I'm capable to doing projects like this while still feeding myself, I absolutely will.

                            <p>
                                The Dark Forest is a world created alongside my Twitch streams. While it initially
                                began as a goofy little side project, it grew into a pretty large idea. It was my first world
                                to be created in WorldAnvil, and it's still occasionally being added to today. It helped me
                                theme many of the events I used for my stream, and it's where the Campgrounds dwell.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Its main storyline chronicles the life of Zephnos, a not-so-happy forest creature tasked with keeping
                                humans away from the Campgrounds. Created to be a captive audience, he's nonetheless conscripted
                                by the Dark Forest itself to act as a guardian for the Campgrounds -- but he's never able to
                                come into the light himself. Over time, it's revealed that much of Zephnos' history is repeating,
                                and it's this repetition that began my interest in story mutation. Zephnos and the forest he
                                dwells in are both very personal to me, even if I don't think they're exactly unique. Indeed,
                                that lack of uniqueness is somewhat the point, as the Dark Forest is known for its tendency
                                to harvest stories and characters.

                            <p>
                                Moonsreach is my second WorldAnvil world. Connected to the Dark Forest
                                through a single character, it's easily the most alien story idea I've ever had... in that all
                                of its characters are literally aliens.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Developed over the course of a single weekend, Moonsreach actually has a complete history
                                from start to finish. This was made much easier through collaboration with my close friend iZ,
                                who helped me hammer out many ideas incredibly fast. While Moonsreach could absolutely be fleshed
                                out more, it was an important step towards understanding the Dark Forest multiverse.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Moonsreach established that the gods in this setting are predatory, and see most sentient life
                                as nothing more a way to accumulate more and more power as they exist. They continue to raise
                                civilizations not out of pride or benevolence, but because it benefits them in the long run.
                                It's this fact that sets the tone for the Dark Forest's gods.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                This is by far my most interesting idea, and one I'd love to flesh out more if I ever found
                                the time. As a world with three completely different alien races who depend on each other to
                                survive, something about it just feels... compelling. Add into this that the planet has no sun
                                and is completely tied to its orbiting lunar goddesses for survival, and there's a ton to play with.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And then of course there's the extra idea that Moonsreach is a massive water world. Completely
                                sheathed in ice all the way up to the barely-present atmosphere, it's a world of ridiculous
                                extremes. Without divine intervention, life would struggle to exist here at all.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I can't overstate how much I do love this world. If it was up to me, I wouldn't have left it
                                in the state that it is for so long. Sadly, Moonsreach is another one of the projects that
                                fell off as other things began to require my time more.

                                Rules of the Dark Forest prevent the monsters that stalk it from entering the light, meaning
                                it's the only place people who fall into it can spend the night without fear. That's changed
                                over time, but this is a story that never fully met its end... fittingly, given that its
                                themes lie in stagnation, corruption of purpose, and an acceptance of the status quo. Thanks
                                to the events of the Dark Forest, nothing ever truly dies.

                                This was initially conceptualized as a way to explain the story events within my Twitch streams,
                                but grew into far more than that. I've tried to tell the Salamanders' (and Zephnos') story
                                three separate times, but something always stops it. Maybe I'll resume it again sometime
                                in the future.

                                YouTube was not something I started with any thoughts of success. I'd played with the ideas
                                of a YouTube channel back before when I was streaming on Twitch, but while that channel
                                was active I simply dismissed it as something that I didn't have the time for. For a long
                                time it was just a place where I stored VODs of my Twitch streams.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When the Campgrounds fire went out, it gave me a new opportunity. I suddenly had a lot
                                more time on my hands, and a few ideas in my brain. The very first video was a short analysis
                                of the ending of Prey, a game I'd loved ever since I streamed it for the first time.
                                To my surprise, conditions aligned and I was catapulted into some level of fame as the
                                video exploded in popularity. For some reason, people cared about what I said on the topic.
                                As a small Twitch channel, this was terrifying to me. I wasn't sure how to respond. What
                                I did know is that I might actually have an opportunity here.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It didn't take me long to learn how fickle the YouTube viewership was. My next video, set
                                up as an artistic response to the comments on the first video, was barely seen by anyone.
                                Still, I'd tasted success and I was determine to keep trying. I had many more topics on hand.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Since then I've gained a lot of experience and skills. I'm now capable of making my own
                                thumbnails. I learned audio editing and production. I wrote, rewrote, and improved script
                                after script. My understanding of what I did right and wrong was increasing with each video.
                                It wasn't until a video on Enderal that I would see more success. The game, a high effort
                                mod for Skyrim, allowed me to contact one of the story directors. From here I realized that
                                with a high enough profile I might be able to really make a difference.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For now my channel remains small, despite my success. I've grown more and more ambitious
                                with each video though. Unfortunately, that also means a rising cost -- I was never one
                                to skimp. This limits my output, but ensures only the highest quality. I love the work
                                flow I've set up, but it definitely has its costs.

                            <h1>A complicated story</h1>
                            <p>The longest project to-date, my time with Project Moon has started back in 2023. I was
                            at the time completely obsessed with Jungian psychology, and Lobotomy Corporation is a game
                            completely built on those ideas. As I dove into the story and lore, more and more of it
                            resonated with me. I strove to make something out of this interest, and started researching
                            the sources. Two years later I had finished both Library of Ruina and a large part of
                            Limbus Company, and was well on my way through video production of my Lobotomy Corporation
                            series. The final video in that series came out on October 6th, 2025.</p>

                            <p>To say this game has me inspired is an understatement. You don't spent two years
                            on a single player game without a good reason. Even now I'm striving to write out a script
                            that can do the second game in the Project Moon universe, Library of Ruina, justice. This
                            project dwarfs everything that came before it.</p>

                            <p>Unfortunately, with a large ambition the budget also ballooned. These videos cost me over
                            a thousand bucks to make each, leaving me with very little return. Despite that, I couldn't be more
                            proud of the outcome. What I've created so far is a feature length documentary dissecting the
                            series, and for those who decided to support my work it's been received incredibly well.
                            The following Library of Ruina videos will come out some day, but it's dependent on funding.
                            As it is, I cannot continue working on this series -- I simply refuse to do so half-heartedly.</p>
