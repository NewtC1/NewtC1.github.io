                                <h1>Welcome!</h1> I am Newt, a strange creature searching for meaning in a life defined by meaninglessness.
                                I've been fascinated by stories of all kinds, and use them as a way to derive meaning. I started life
                                as a programmer, but have since turned into more of a researcher and writer. While I'm fascinated
                                by stories of all kinds and mediums, I am trying to teach myself the art of adaptation rather than
                                creation. My interest in how these tales mutate with each retelling, and as such I do a lot of writing
                                on established works.

                                I went to college for programming, but have always had a love of art. I've spent some time doing 3D modeling,
                                drawing and even some real life sculpting. During my time as a Twitch streamer I put my abilities as a
                                writer to use, allowing me to craft a world that my stream's events took place in. As a YouTube creator I started
                                to use Gimp more often, and now have a decent understanding of how to make professional looking thumbnails for
                                the purposes of attracting attention. On top of all of this, I spend plenty of time writing and reviewing scripts
                                and working with others on videos. None of my projects are solo, though I arguably have the largest part in each one.

                                Due to my large number of interests, I'm always driven to learn new skills. This means I'm constantly
                                facing situations or problems I've never seen before, or looking back at issues I once thought impossible
                                with my current skill set. I despise working on the same rote issues day after day, which has led me
                                to quit a few jobs once I felt I wasn't learning anything new from them.

                                Regardless of what I do, I do not do so half-heartedly. I have been known to spend years on my passion projects.
                                I don't expect that to change anytime soon. Works on projects like my Lobotomy Corporation story retrospective
                                took over a year, and if I'm capable to doing projects like this while still feeding myself, I absolutely will.
