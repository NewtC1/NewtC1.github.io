                            <p>
                                I am Newt, a strange creature searching for meaning in a life defined by meaninglessness.
                                I've been fascinated by stories of all kinds, and use them as a way to derive meaning. I started life
                                as a programmer, but have since turned into more of a researcher and writer. While I'm fascinated
                                by stories of all kinds and mediums, I am trying to teach myself the art of adaptation rather than
                                creation. My interest in how these tales mutate with each retelling, and as such I do a lot of writing
                                on established works.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Even I don't fully understand where my interest in stories comes from. I love all of them --
                                even the bad ones. I'm not looking for quality of stories, but and understanding of why we
                                write them and how we tell them. For me, stories and memories are a large part of the human
                                identity. Without the tales we tell around the fire we cannot communicate who we are. It's by
                                understanding another person's history that we can bridge the gap in human experience, and
                                I think this is a large part of why we feel obliged to tell them.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Ultimately, these differences in perspective and the mutations they create in retelling the
                                same story are where my interest lies. If I can understand that and find a way to quantify
                                it, I can understand others -- and myself -- better.

                            <h1> Never stop learning </h1>
                            <p>
                                I went to college for programming, but have always had a love of art. I've spent some time doing 3D modeling,
                                drawing and even some real life sculpting. During my time as a Twitch streamer I put my abilities as a
                                writer to use, allowing me to craft a world that my stream's events took place in. As a YouTube creator I started
                                to use Gimp more often, and now have a decent understanding of how to make professional looking thumbnails for
                                the purposes of attracting attention. On top of all of this, I spend plenty of time writing and reviewing scripts
                                and working with others on videos. None of my projects are solo, though I arguably have the largest part in each one.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Well... I say that, but a large majority of my writing and world build projects are born
                                from my own experiences. The Dark Forest is a personal project and a direct representation
                                of how I view the world. It wasn't until I started writing it that I was able to express
                                ideas that I never fully formed before that. I find writing therapeutic -- it's easier to
                                think once you've put it on a page.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                During my early jobs, I was able to learn a great deal of Python code. This code went into
                                the development of Salamandbot, and firmly cemented me as a self-taught programmer. While
                                I went to college for programming life got in my way, so almost everything I use now are
                                learned through practical application. I prefer it that way anyway.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On top of my programming and writing skills, I pick up a lot of smaller skills that I use
                                less often, such as Gimp, Blender and Reaper. I'm fairly good at learning tools, but
                                understand that it's only through prolonged exposure I can truly master them. After my
                                earliest jobs I lost opportunities to increase my programming skills professionally, and
                                now I'm using my current unemployment as a way to improve all of these. Who knows? Maybe
                                I'll last long enough to pick up something I never thought I'd work in. It wouldn't be
                                the first time.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I've actually worked as a 3D modeler for a movie, though it's unlikely anyone's ever
                                heard of it. Before I went to college I was quite passionate about Blender, and found
                                an opportunity to put those skills to use. Just an odd factoid.

                                Regardless of what I do, I do not do so half-heartedly. I have been known to spend years on my passion projects.
                                I don't expect that to change anytime soon. Works on projects like my Lobotomy Corporation story retrospective
                                took over a year, and if I'm capable to doing projects like this while still feeding myself, I absolutely will.

                            <p>
                                The Dark Forest is a world created alongside my Twitch streams. While it initially
                                began as a goofy little side project, it grew into a pretty large idea. It was my first world
                                to be created in WorldAnvil, and it's still occasionally being added to today. It helped me
                                theme many of the events I used for my stream, and it's where the Campgrounds dwell.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Its main storyline chronicles the life of Zephnos, a not-so-happy forest creature tasked with keeping
                                humans away from the Campgrounds. Created to be a captive audience, he's nonetheless conscripted
                                by the Dark Forest itself to act as a guardian for the Campgrounds -- but he's never able to
                                come into the light himself. Over time, it's revealed that much of Zephnos' history is repeating,
                                and it's this repetition that began my interest in story mutation. Zephnos and the forest he
                                dwells in are both very personal to me, even if I don't think they're exactly unique. Indeed,
                                that lack of uniqueness is somewhat the point, as the Dark Forest is known for its tendency
                                to harvest stories and characters.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Ultimately, this story remains unfinished less due to a lack of desire or direction, and
                                more due to a lack of time. Given how many times I've tried to write it, I have a solid idea
                                of where it would end. I just have no interest currently in ending it. So it remains as
                                a simple setting with an unfinished narrative.

                                The Campgrounds houses the Salamander and its fire.
                                Rules of the Dark Forest prevent the monsters that stalk it from entering the light, meaning
                                it's the only place people who fall into it can spend the night without fear. That's changed
                                over time, but this is a story that never fully met its end... fittingly, given that its
                                themes lie in stagnation, corruption of purpose, and an acceptance of the status quo. Thanks
                                to the events of the Dark Forest, nothing ever truly dies.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This was initially conceptualized as a way to explain the story events within my Twitch streams,
                                but grew into far more than that. I've tried to tell the Salamanders' (and Zephnos') story
                                three separate times, but something always stops it. Maybe I'll resume it again sometime
                                in the future.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Is the Salamander supposed to be me? I don't know. Some people equate it to me, and I
                                guess the use of salamander icons is my trademark at this point. I think it's an
                                unfinished and incomplete version of me. Whatever it's supposed to represent, it always
                                dies at the end of the story, only to be reborn without memories. It somehow knows an
                                infinite number of stories, and always creates Zephnos. The Salamander is both trapped
                                in the cycle and the creator of it. It's driven mad by the Dark Forest but has no choice
                                but to remain in the Campgrounds. It cannot leave, but staying hurts.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When I started my Twitch streams and made the Salamander, it was as a mascot character.
                                Then, it absolutely was me. I sat with everyone and gave them shelter while trying to tell
                                any stories I found interesting. That's what the streams were. A fire was lit and I created
                                Salamandbot to allow people to throw logs into it. Events were added that happened each year.
                                I grew as a person, and so did the lore of the Campgrounds.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The fire, inevitably, died. One of my events was too harsh, and streams ended permanently.
                                Eventually though, I came back -- but not as the Salamander. Just as me, Newt. The Campgrounds
                                is not meant to be safety. It's a prison of comfort, for me and me alone. When it died,
                                the real me moved on. I left the Salamander and its Dark Forest in the past.

                                from start to finish. This was made much easier through collaboration with my close friend iZ,
                                who helped me hammer out many ideas incredibly fast. While Moonsreach could absolutely be fleshed
                                out more, it was an important step towards understanding the Dark Forest multiverse.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Moonsreach established that the gods in this setting are predatory, and see most sentient life
                                as nothing more a way to accumulate more and more power as they exist. They continue to raise
                                civilizations not out of pride or benevolence, but because it benefits them in the long run.
                                It's this fact that sets the tone for the Dark Forest's gods.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This is by far my most interesting idea, and one I'd love to flesh out more if I ever found
                                the time. As a world with three completely different alien races who depend on each other to
                                survive, something about it just feels... compelling. Add into this that the planet has no sun
                                and is completely tied to its orbiting lunar goddesses for survival, and there's a ton to play with.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And then of course there's the extra idea that Moonsreach is a massive water world. Completely
                                sheathed in ice all the way up to the barely-present atmosphere, it's a world of ridiculous
                                extremes. Without divine intervention, life would struggle to exist here at all.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And yet, there is life. The Three Sisters, lunar gods that orbited the planet, decided
                                to intervene. Two of them forced life into existence. When those races, the Crabs and the
                                Siphons fought, a third race was created to keep the peace. Together, they began to right
                                wrongs and communed. They became the Order of the Falling Star, and the whole planet began
                                to progress.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I can't overstate how much I do love this world. If it was up to me, I wouldn't have left it
                                in the state that it is for so long. Sadly, Moonsreach is another one of the projects that
                                fell off as other things began to require my time more.

                                A title reused from an idea with the Dark Forest, the Stone of Stories is the name I've
                                given to my collection of notes that I make publicly available. These notes track the ideas
                                and thoughts I have as I research various video topics, and are available for anyone interested
                                in how the sausage is made. I'm still working through the display process on this, so it's liable
                                to change over time.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As I write videos, I generally put together a pretty large collection of notes on the story.
                                This collection goes here. Initially I had this hidden behind a paywall, but over time I've
                                decided to make these notes public due to the complication of paywalling them to begin with.
                                After all, I put all the effort in, why shouldn't people be able to see them?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Currently only two games have notes here, but I have numerous other non-video-related notes.
                                The biggest grouping is the collection of notes on storytelling themes and how they relate to
                                each other. Eventually I plan to take these and make them into something more substantial, but
                                in what form I have no idea.

                                My Twitch career really started with Salamandbot. It was once I added the campfire system,
                                a small timer that started counting down unless viewers added to it, that things got going.
                                The Campfire was the start of the Campgrounds, and viewers knew if it ever went out, streams
                                would end for good. Adding to that I gave viewers other things to use their logs on. A voting
                                system was implemented. Viewers were now able to guide which direction my streams took.
                                Safeguards were put in place. Audio effects were added. The streams got better and better.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My first story event was our Halloween defense. Monsters would come out of the Dark Forest
                                surrounding the Campgrounds and attack the fire. Sometimes they would be easy. At this
                                point there wasn't that much viewers could do but refuel the fire as it went out. And then
                                I started writing the storyline behind the Dark Forest.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Zephnos was created first. The first god of the woods, he stole the moon from the sky.
                                Gradually, more mythology was built up. I commissioned additional art for the Dark Forest,
                                and started to write the chapters.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Every year, Salamandbot got better. Events grew more complex. Viewers could command the
                                guardians of the Campgrounds to deal with threats. Eventually, they got the ability to
                                buy relics from the passing merchant Cicero, who was also accounted for in the deeper lore.
                                A story and its end was formed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Streams began to drop off, and I didn't know why. While I was continuing to develop the story,
                                my pace slowed. I got tired of the streams. Eventually less and less people showed up.
                                During one of my harsher yearly events, nicknamed Overheat, logs finally ran out. I
                                accepted it as it was. The streams ended, and I moved on. This wasn't the end of my community though.

                                YouTube was not something I started with any thoughts of success. I'd played with the ideas
                                of a YouTube channel back before when I was streaming on Twitch, but while that channel
                                was active I simply dismissed it as something that I didn't have the time for. For a long
                                time it was just a place where I stored VODs of my Twitch streams.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When the Campgrounds fire went out, it gave me a new opportunity. I suddenly had a lot
                                more time on my hands, and a few ideas in my brain. The very first video was a short analysis
                                of the ending of Prey, a game I'd loved ever since I streamed it for the first time.
                                To my surprise, conditions aligned and I was catapulted into some level of fame as the
                                video exploded in popularity. For some reason, people cared about what I said on the topic.
                                As a small Twitch channel, this was terrifying to me. I wasn't sure how to respond. What
                                I did know is that I might actually have an opportunity here.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It didn't take me long to learn how fickle the YouTube viewership was. My next video, set
                                up as an artistic response to the comments on the first video, was barely seen by anyone.
                                Still, I'd tasted success and I was determine to keep trying. I had many more topics on hand.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Since then I've gained a lot of experience and skills. I'm now capable of making my own
                                thumbnails. I learned audio editing and production. I wrote, rewrote, and improved script
                                after script. My understanding of what I did right and wrong was increasing with each video.
                                It wasn't until a video on Enderal that I would see more success. The game, a high effort
                                mod for Skyrim, allowed me to contact one of the story directors. From here I realized that
                                with a high enough profile I might be able to really make a difference.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For now my channel remains small, despite my success. I've grown more and more ambitious
                                with each video though. Unfortunately, that also means a rising cost -- I was never one
                                to skimp. This limits my output, but ensures only the highest quality. I love the work
                                flow I've set up, but it definitely has its costs.

                                Salamandbot is my personal attempt at a Python chatbot. Initially created to administer
                                the log system in my Twitch streams, it's now gone through quite a few iterations. It
                                started as an extension to Ankhbot, which has now turned into the Streamlabs Chatbot.
                                Once it became clear that Ankhbot was never being updated, I ended up building a new chatbot
                                and porting most of the code that made it into Ankhbot. As a result, Salamandbot has some
                                very old parts, and is currently being updated to more modern code.

                                The current version of <a href="https://github.com/NewtC1/Salamandbot2.0">Salamandbot</a>
                                is runnable on most PCs, but does require some setup from environment variables. Since it
                                wasn't intended for redistribution, the readme isn't fleshed out.

                                Right now Salamandbot can connect to both Twitch and Discord, and it listens in specific
                                channels set in the settings.toml file. Whenever it gets a response, it sends the string
                                to its command parser. This command parser checks the list of commands, and then sends
                                the output string back to whichever source it came from.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This was originally intended to also work with YouTube, but I found that YouTube's chat
                                code didn't interface well with Salamandbot. On top of that, I was running into problems
                                with the API limits. Unlike Twitch, YouTube had a fairly strict limit on how bots could
                                read its code, and at least while I was still working on it I was never able to overcome
                                that limitation. This limited Salamandbot's YouTube uptime to around an hour, and it was
                                shortened by having more people in chat talking.

                                Salamandbot needs to be updated to modern Twitch EventSubs, and it's something I've
                                yet to get around to. However, it has recently been updated to the most recent version
                                of TwitchIO and Discord.py, so it's perfectly capable of accepting fixes again... when
                                I have the time.

                                If I did ever get back into streaming, this would be one of the first things I would want
                                to fix. Not having a chatbot around makes things quite annoying to manage, and Salamandbot
                                was one of the reasons I was able to build the community I did.

                            <p>
                                The longest project to-date, my time with Project Moon has started back in 2023. I was
                                at the time completely obsessed with Jungian psychology, and Lobotomy Corporation is a game
                                completely built on those ideas. As I dove into the story and lore, more and more of it
                                resonated with me. I strove to make something out of this interest, and started researching
                                the sources. Two years later I had finished both Library of Ruina and a large part of
                                Limbus Company, and was well on my way through video production of my Lobotomy Corporation
                                series. The final video in that series came out on October 6th, 2025.

                                To say this game has me inspired is an understatement. You don't spent two years
                                on a single player game without a good reason. Even now I'm striving to write out a script
                                that can do the second game in the Project Moon universe, Library of Ruina, justice. This
                                project dwarfs everything that came before it.
                            </p>

                                Unfortunately, with a large ambition the budget also ballooned. These videos cost me over
                                a thousand bucks to make each, leaving me with very little return. Despite that, I couldn't be more
                                proud of the outcome. What I've created so far is a feature length documentary dissecting the
                                series, and for those who decided to support my work it's been received incredibly well.
                                The following Library of Ruina videos will come out some day, but it's dependent on funding.
                                As it is, I cannot continue working on this series -- I simply refuse to do so half-heartedly.

                                available for viewing in the Stone of Stories. The problem with this game is pretty
                                simple: I can't record it with my current
