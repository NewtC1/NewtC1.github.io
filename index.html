                    <h1>A fascination with stories</h1>
                    <p>
                        Welcome! I am Newt, a strange creature searching for meaning in a life defined by meaninglessness.
                        I've been fascinated by stories of all kinds, and use them as a way to derive meaning. I started life
                        as a programmer, but have since turned into more of a researcher and writer. While I'm fascinated
                        by stories of all kinds and mediums, I am trying to teach myself the art of adaptation rather than
                        creation. My interest in how these tales mutate with each retelling, and as such I do a lot of writing
                        on established works.
